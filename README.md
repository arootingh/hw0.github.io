# HW0 â€“ HTML Elements Practice

## Elements I added
- `<img>` with `alt` and `loading="lazy"`
- `<a>` with `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener"`
- `<blockquote>` with `cite`
- `<form>` with `<input>` and attributes like `placeholder` and `required`
- `<details>` with `<summary>`

## Findings
- Attributes improve accessibility and usability.
- `<details>` and `<summary>` add interactivity without JavaScript.
- `<blockquote>` with `cite` can link a quote to its source.
